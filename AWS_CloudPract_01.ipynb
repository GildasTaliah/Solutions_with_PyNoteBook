        "Every day we interact with the cloud—whether it’s using Google Drive, apps like Salesforce, or accessing our favorite websites. Cloud computing has become the norm for many companies, but what exactly is the cloud and why is everyone rushing to adopt it? Designed for absolute novices, this course breaks down what the cloud is and explains terminology such as scalability, latency, and high-availability. You'll learn about the many advantages including ease of remote collaboration, how there are no hardware limitations, and reliable disaster recovery. You'll also discover the range of tools provided by major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. By the end of this course, you'll be able to confidently explain how cloud tools can increase productivity and save money, as well as ask the right questions about how to optimize your use of cloud tools."
